It is meant to be usable in live coding sessions, during technical interviews, with an environment like GitHub Codespaces, or Azure Dev Box.

# Use in GitHub Codespace

This is the simplest to use, and doesn't require any installation. GitHub proposes 120 core-hours per month to GitHub Free account holders.

1. Fork that repository into your own repository
2. Create a new codespace: https://github.com/codespaces/new
3. Open the folder of your choice, and use the instructions in the language specific README.md to run or test the program.

# Use locally

This can be used locally, during a coding dojo session, to allow participants to experiment with multiple programming languages with low barriers.
(Although they need to have the compiler installed on their PC. The instructions are given in the language specific folder.)
# Livecoding Bootstraps

This repository provides minimal bootstrap programs in multiple programming languages, designed for live coding sessions, technical interviews, and coding dojos.

## Overview
This project helps you quickly start coding in your language of choice, with minimal setup. Each language folder contains its own README.md with instructions.

## Usage in GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is the easiest way to use this repository—no installation required. GitHub Free accounts get 120 core-hours per month.

1. Fork this repository into your own account.
2. [Create a new Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new).
3. Open the folder for your chosen language and follow its README.md instructions to run or test the program.

## Local Usage
You can use this repository locally for coding dojos or practice. You’ll need to have the appropriate compiler/interpreter installed for each language. See the language-specific README.md for setup and instructions.

## Available Languages
- PHP ([php-composer/README.md](php-composer/README.md))
<!-- Add more languages here as you add them -->
